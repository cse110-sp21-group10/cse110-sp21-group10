# Main Bullet Journal Design Based Off Wireframes
* Status: Accepted
* Deciders: Asya, Akar, Akhil, Brian, Huy, Ivan, Nathan, Praneet, Ryan
* Date: 2021-04-02
​

## Context and Problem Statement
We want to have a solid reference for the design of our Bullet Journal.

What should we look to if we have a question about the design?
​

## Decision Drivers

* We all wanted to agree on one design.
* We wanted to make sure each of us was on the same page regarding how the BuJo would look.
* Needed a template to start coding the HTMLs off of.
​

## Considered Options

* Ivan rendered the first versions by drawing out some sketches.
* The sketches were then updated with consecutive design meetins (seen on Miro board).
* Akar then recommended the online resource Figma and volunteered to turn the sketches into wireframes.
* Up in the air, hopefully everyone is on the same page. Basically only in our minds.
​

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: "Wireframes", because
​
* Easy to access.
* The clarity of the diagrams is unparalleled.
* Easy to make changes if the team desides on a design change.
* The Figma disagram structure breaks the pages into sections that are good guidelines for the HTML.
