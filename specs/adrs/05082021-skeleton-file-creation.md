​

## Context and Problem Statement
We needed to decide whether or not we wanted to create strict rules for the creation of the HTML skeleton or stick with the more general format that we all know. 
​

## Decision Drivers

* We couldn't really find a very specific style guide for HTML as everything is pretty standarized already. 
* We all knew that we should break everything up into sections and use divs
​

## Considered Options

* Considered using Google's guide, but it was mixed with CSS
* Doing our own thing and having the Front End teams pick which style worked best and iterate off of that

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: "our way (kinda)", because
​
* we couldn't find an external style guide for html
* everyone already had the same general style for html
* it wouldn't be too hard to change the skeletons as it's a very outline

### Positive Consequences

* It's easy to get all the skeletons up 

### Negative Consequences

* There could be vastly different skeletons, although it is doubtful.
