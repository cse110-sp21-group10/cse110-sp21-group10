​
## Context and Problem Statement
When creating the foundation for our BuJo pages, we want a fast and
realiable way to create the pages.
What should the process be by which we create the fundumantal HTML pages?
​
​
## Decision Drivers
* We would like the goundations for the HTML part of the pages to be done quickly.
* We need everyone to know what parts the pages will consist of.
* Need skeletons for the pages initially with the HTML so furure front end teams can add to them.
  
​
## Considered Options
* All subgroups get their own page and have to code the basic HTML themselves.
* We code each page as a group, so everyone is satisfied and happy with the basic layout/fundumental choices.
* Have one HTML code template that all the pages are based off of and extend from.
  
​
## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: Mix of "subteams on their own" and "standard template for all the pages", because
​
* A standard template would streamline the process of creating the basic HTML.
* The subteam would have a basis to start the code from.
* The basic HTML for all the pages would get done faster if we split up into teams.
* Later front-end teams could work off f the HTML skeletons.
* Each subteam can get familiar with their page so when the CSS and JS start, they already know where to begin.
