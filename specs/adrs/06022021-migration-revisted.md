* Status: Rejected
* Deciders: Asya, Akar, Akhil, Huy, Ivan, Nathan, Praneet, Ryan
* Date: 2021-06-02
​

## Context and Problem Statement
We want to integrate migration, but we are running out of time for the deadline of the project. 

Do we have time to integrate migration and is it essential?

## Decision Drivers

* Our bullet journal functions perfectly without migration.
* You can currently mark a bullet as "migrate", indicating it needs to migrated.
* We have about a week left and many essential functions to implement.
* Labeling, styling, testing and acessibility are more important.
​
## Considered Options

* Implement migration potentially taking time away from more essential functions, or even worse, fail.
* Don't implement migration and focus on other essential features.
​

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: "Abandon migration", because
​
* It is not an essential function to our BuJo functionality.
* Time is running out.
* User can manually migrate notes.
