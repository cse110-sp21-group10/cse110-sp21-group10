# Going the more general route for our BuJo vs the more specific route
* Status: Accepted
* Deciders: Asya, Akar, Akhil, Brian, Huy, Ivan, Nathan, Praneet, Ryan

​

## Context and Problem Statement
We needed to decide whether or not we wanted to design our BuJo around a more specific set of users or if we wanted it to be more general in that a wide variety of users could use it.

Do we want to cater to a specific group of users or a wider, more general group?
​

## Decision Drivers

* We needed to decide on a route before working on the design anymore. It was halting progress.
* We wanted to make sure everyone had a say in this decision.
* Needed to solidfy our idea and make the problem statement ours.
​

## Considered Options

* Considered going down a specific route, like a finance or cooking centered BuJo 
* More generic form that could be used for anything.

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: "Generic Options", because
​
* Easier to create more features.
* Feels more authentic to the style of bullet journals.
* Going the specific route feels like it would narrow our audience too much.

### Positive Consequences

* We would have a larger variety of users that we can pull ffrom in order to make our journal
* More of the team is interested in going this route, so engagement and interest with/in the project will be higher than if we went the other route.

### Negative Consequences

* We may not be very unique compared to the other bullet journals being made
* Our product may be too generic - we don't want to become too generic in the fact that we're going for a minimalistic design
