## Context and Problem Statement
We needed to decide what system to use for storing notes and other content that users create when using our BuJo. We wanted to store data locally, but we had to decide between a couple of different options for doing so.

Do we want to use localStorage or IndexedDB to store user data for our app?
​

## Decision Drivers

* We needed to decide on a storage system before working on the storage structure anymore. It was hindering progress.
* We wanted to make sure everyone had a say in this decision.
* Needed to decide on a system and commit to it for future development.
​

## Considered Options

* Use localStorage, which is a relatively simple, synchronous API
* Use IndexedDB, which is a little more complex but has more functionality

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: "IndexedDB", because
​
* localStorage does not have enough storage (it is only around 5-10 MB from what we read) for our anticipated users' needs (ex. storing images or audio)
* IndexedDB operates more like a traditional database (ex. object stores have similar functionality to database tables), so we figure it would be more clearly organized
* IndexedDB is well suited for storing objects (i.e. JSON objects), which is how we expect to best structure our data
