​

## Context and Problem Statement
The user should be able to group bullets/notes together, like a collection of sorts.
How can they do this in the most effective way?
​

## Decision Drivers

* We want the user to be able to assign a label to bullet points so they can group similar notes together.
* The method we choose needs to not be difficult for the user to do.
* We have the ability to do labeling with our bullet structures, so once we implement it, it shouldn't be too difficult to integrate that into database storage.
​

## Considered Options

* Multi-select labeling
* Labeling button for each bullet point
​

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: "Labeling Button", because
​
* Easy to access.
* Not too difficult to implement.
* Will work with the other buttons we currently have.
* We don't quite know how to do a mass-selection mode right now.
