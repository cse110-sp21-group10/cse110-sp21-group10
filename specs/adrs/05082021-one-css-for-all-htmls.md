## Context and Problem Statement
When styling the HTML with CSS, we want to style in the most effiecient and
practical way possible.

What should the process be by which we style all the HTMLs?
​
​
## Decision Drivers
* We would like the styling of the CSS pages to be streamlined.
* We need everyone on the same page regarding the default/basic color wave of the BuJo.
* Need a basis for all the pages to start from regarding styling which can expand if needed.
* Basically so all the pages look like they're from the same app, and not made by different teams.
  
​
## Considered Options
* All subgroups get their own page and have to style it by themselves.
* We style each page as a group, so everyone is satisfied and happy with the style choices.
* Have one CSS style sheet that all the pages are based off of and extend from.
  
​
## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: "One style sheet for all HTML pages", because
​
* The process of styling a page would become easier with something as a base.
* All the pages would look reletively similar in terms of style insead of each page a bit off/different.
* More convenient and faster in terms of reusing code.
* Lets there be teams that work on the extended CSS for each individual page that offshoot from one central style.
