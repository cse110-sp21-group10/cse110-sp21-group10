## Context and Problem Statement
We want to allow users to take notes as quickly as possible.

How do we minimize overhead and allow rapid logging?

## Decision Drivers

* Rapid logging is a core principle of BuJo
* A homepage's function can spread out and aren't needed
* A homepage blocks the user from instantly taking notes
​
## Considered Options

* The other option would be to have some kind of directory homepage that guides you to the proper section.
* Making the daily log the homepage makes it slightly harder to get to other sections, but the most used log is much easier to access (the daily log)
* This option makes the most sense for BuJo
​

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: "Daily Log homepage", because
​
* It promotes rapid logging
* It removes unecessary screens from the journal
* It makes it faster to access the journal's most used component
