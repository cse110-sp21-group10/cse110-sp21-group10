## Context and Problem Statement
We needed to decide how we would add additional pages the user may have for the day. 

Did we want to create a brand new page and link it somehow to the daily page or did we want to add it on to our current daily page, but below the daily log?​

## Decision Drivers

* We wanted the user to be able to do this quickly.
* We also wanted to ensure that the user could quickly access any notes/stuff they add to the daily page.
* We weren't sure about how difficult it would be to actually create and link new pages to the same date, especially if there wasn't a limit to the number of pages that could be made.
​

## Considered Options

* Creating and linking new pages.
* Creating new sections and appending that below the daily log section.

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: "new section and appending", because
​
* We wouldn't have to deal with linking and storing multiple new pages for retrieval to one day.
* User will be able to quickly see what additional stuff they added to one day without having to click multiple buttons.
