* Status: Accepted

​

## Context and Problem Statement
We want the users to reflect on their decisions and their notes. We also want users to be able to get rid of useless tasks.

How should we encourages users to reflect on the notes they rapid log?

## Decision Drivers

* A key part of BuJo is reflection
* A lot of times, people continue to push something off they need to do and they never address it
​
## Considered Options

* The default option is of course to just let users migrate a task as many times as they want without notifying them of anything.
* We quickly realized that prompting and asking the user if they really want to keep a task migrated a ton of times forces them to confront the task while also giving them the freedom to move it or not.
* Because it maitained user freedom but encouraged reflection, everyone liked this.
​

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: "Migraiton Notifications", because
​
* It enables user reflection
* It removes clutter from user BuJo
* It is more interactive but preserves user freedom
