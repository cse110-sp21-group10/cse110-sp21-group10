# Chose to use pupeteer for functions that can't be easily unit tested
* Status: Accepted

​

## Context and Problem Statement
We need to test all our code and functions, but many functions can't be unit tested because of interaction with the window and database.

Do we use jest-puppeteer or Cyprus?

## Decision Drivers

* Cyprus would mean we have to learn a new framework
* Cyprus generates a coverage report
* Puppeteer doesn't generate a coverage report
* Puppeteer works well with jest
* Puppeteer is something we are familar with
​

## Considered Options

* Use the Cyprus framework to test and merge the coverage report with unit tests
* Use jest puppeteer and just talk about coverage in the documentation

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: "Jest Puppeteer", because
​
* Jest Puppeteer is a system we are familiar with
* We don't need a coverage report for these End to End tests as long we explain it in the documentation
