​

## Context and Problem Statement
We want the user to be able to able to easily move between the daily, monthly, and yearly log.

How should we design the journal so that this transition is smooth and makes sense?
​

## Decision Drivers

* We want a unique design to set us apart from other BuJos.
* We want to minimize load times so everything is as rapid as possible.
* Transition must be smooth.
​

## Considered Options

* We considered the option of accessing the different logs from some sort of menu that allows to navigate to each with a hyperlink.
* However, after seeing inspiring programs like Google Earth or the calendar on your iPhone, we considered a zoom out function, which accomplishes the same purpose but in a smoother way.
​

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: "Zoom In and Out", because
​
* it's smooth (it looks better)
* it's intuituve
* it minimizes load times
