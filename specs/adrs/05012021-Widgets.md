## Context and Problem Statement
We want the user to be able to track a variety of things over a period of time, but also store those trackers in a neat a unique way to them.

How should we display trackers in our BuJo?

## Decision Drivers

* We want the BuJo to give users freedom to do what they want
* We want each tracker to be seperated from other features
* We want it to be clear that something is a widget
​

## Considered Options

* We considered putting all trackers at the top of the page or bottom of the page by default.
* We then realized in some cases this may look cluttered.
* If users could control where widgets were and how they looked, it would look better and give users freedom.
* Everyone liked this option.
​

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: "Customizable Widgets", because
​
* It looks better
* It gives the user more freedom
* It makes our BuJo more unique
