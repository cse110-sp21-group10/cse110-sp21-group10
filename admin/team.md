### Akar Singh

Hey! I'm Akar (Singh), a 2nd year Computer Engineering major. In my free time I like to read manga and play video games. Right now I have a bit of an obsession over automation, usually spending more time writing scripts than using them.

### Akhilan Ganesh

Hi, I'm Akhilan Ganesh. I'm a second year CS major. I like to play videogames, read non-fiction books, meditate, and watch anime. I don't have a perfect job/dream to work for/in, but I hope that with the skills I learn from college I can build scalable and dependable software or other technologies that can economically uplift the most marginalized. I am also considering an education route since I like teaching things. I don't want to do only one thing for my whole career.
