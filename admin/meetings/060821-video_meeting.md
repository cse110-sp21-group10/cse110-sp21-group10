## Discussion Points
- this meeting was just about our plan to complete the final videos for our project
  - the two videos we need to create are the public video (max 4.5 min, demo of our project) and the private video (max 15 min, discussion of our repo and adherence to Agile)
- to ensure that everyone on the team has a say in the videos, we took meeting notes/planned our videos together on Google Docs
  - all the notes for our video plan can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XZ-r1XVxGwB4ovP0in8KJgz_VNHk-ZAnG5Su-ZgJwa8/edit)
