## Discussion Points
- Note: I (Akar) Joined the meeting 15 minutes late, was using the wrong zoom link sorry!
- Wowowow some groups have gotten whole wireframes flowcharts out already
- Brainstorming assignment didn't have concrete deliverables and was more open
to interpretation
    - Don't undermine your contribution (what we have is more than expected)
    - Be happy about the progress you made :)
- Prioritization of functionalities are very helpful for constructing user 
    stories
- The problem statement brainstorming is a great setup for creating user personas!
- Some of the other teams mentioned a subteam for design, testing, front-end,
    backend, etc.
- A team mentioned aiming to get core functionality working by week 8, with the
    remaining 2 weeks as cushioning.
- Me personally (Akar) I haven't really seen any online implementation of BuJos
    yet but it seems like some other teams are modeling some functionalities
    based off implemenations they've found online.
    - I feel like this might be useful if inspiration is needed but I fear 
    falling into the pit of deciding on implementations and adjusting the needs
    of the user to justify the time/effort spent learning the implementation :/
- A nice concept a group introduced was having a pool of 'extra functionality'
    to choose from after core functionality is working (week 8+) to choose from
- A group correlated features with particular user personas / use cases
- The 'Word Map' a group used to define bullet journals could be useful for
    organizing the info from our sticky notes 
- A lot of the teams used graphics to help explain the ideas that members had
    - In addition to being a useful demo aide, the permanence of a graphic will
    be useful in the long run (since people might not hold the same image in
    their head forever!)
- Minimal Viable Product (MVP) should be completed with ample time for testing!
- We could polish up the Miro board to organize/format info from our brainmap 
    into maybe particular frames for:
    - Diagramming / Flowcharts
    - User personas
    - Design 
    - Group organization
    - Backlog
    - Pitch
        - ppt format is fine
        - notify Sanat for approval before submitting but meeting isn't req
## Meeting End Time: 5:00 PST
