## Notes
- team radar
  - team mostly agreed that clarity is somewhat low
    - definitely something that can be improved next sprint with full design documentation
  - engagement was quite high overall
  - other factors (autonomy, mastery, impact) were around average (around 3 on a 1-5 scale)
- mad/sad/glad activity
  - mad
    - most voted: people always feel behind on the project even though we are supposedly on track
    - people feel that the project is much too vague
      - we have put in a good amount of work in the past few days creating specific documentation to reduce that vagueness
    - people feel that there is a time crunch (too much work to do when considering the project in addition to the labs and work for other classes and other commitments)
    - some teams were given more work than others (uneven distribution)
      - discussed that this is something that can be resolved by voicing your opinion (either to the team leads or in general) when you feel that your team has been given too much, or the opposite (if you feel your team hasn't been given enough)
      - create more defined splits of work
      - specify team assignments (to the best of our ability)
      - plan work early, and update team midweek
      - if you're going to ask for help, prepare a small demo to explain your progress to another team in ideally 15-30 minutes
  - sad
    - most voted: people feel that there are different expectations for the mvp
      - we concluded that this will hopefully be alleviated by the centralized design document that everyone can reference
    - people feel that there are some features they want to see implemented but there isn't enough time to finish them
    - things take longer than expected and are sad that the project takes so much time in addition to the other requirements of this and other classes
      - if you have free time, try experimenting with things in the dev console so that during later meetings with your team you can spend less time figuring out the tools
    - some people feel that they aren't doing enough but don't really know what to do
      - let other teams know if you have time to help them
      - do some research into helpful tools on your own time if you can
      - stay updated on the Miro board
    - time crunch (too many classes, too little time)
  - glad
    - teamwork!
      - people feel that there is good/respectful communication
      - team has been getting along well as a whole
        - hardly any conflicts (if at all)
      - teams are engaged and responsive
    - we have a working mvp/frontend
      - we were able to mostly achieve our goal for the sprint
## Meeting End Time: 10:15pm PST
