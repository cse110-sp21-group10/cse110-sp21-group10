  - Make sure to adhere to Agile and other principles of Software Engineering throughout the project
  - Good teams get ahead on assignments
    - If there’s something you know you can do, you don’t have to wait for it to be assigned!
  - Grading
    - It is a group grade, but individual grades can be adjusted based on how engaged you are and how much you help the team
    - Most of the grade is actually about the process and your interactions with the team
  - Try to attend lectures live
    - There might be participation points
    - Also this is how you learn the principles of Software Engineering you need to succeed on the project
- Came up with a short project description for the README
  - "We'll be creating a Bullet Journal--a place for you to track your thoughts and daily life--through adherence to Agile development."
  - This will be edited/updated as we get a better idea of our team’s approach to the project
- Group bonding activity
    - We will be playing Among Us and/or skribbl.io today (April 13) at 5:30pm PST
## Action items
- Research bullet journals and think about your interpretation of them
- Come up with a few values/rules that you think should go in the team contract
- Think about possible ideas for branding items (colors, team name, logo, etc)
