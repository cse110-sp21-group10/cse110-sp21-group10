## Notes
- team radar
  - clarity score is much better than last sprint
    - this was improved by centralized documentation and subteam communication
  - engagement was around average
  - other factors (mastery, meaning, impact) were good (average around 4 on a 1-5 scale)
    - people understand what they are doing and feel that their contributions were impactful :)
    - this also improved from last sprint, where people were on average much more uncertain of what they are contributing to the project
- mad/sad/glad activity
  - immediately notable: last sprint, we had many more things in the mad/sad columns, but this time the glad column had the most notes by far!
  - mad
    - most voted: people feel that there is still a big time crunch
      - there was a lot packed into the sprint development wise, but it was necessary because most of the project development had to be done in this sprint
      - the large amount of work created lots of meetings that went on for long periods of time
      - this will hopefully not be the case in the next sprint because we made such substantial progress in the last sprint
        - the next sprint will be more about tying things together and focusing on testing
    - 
  - sad
    - most voted: people feel that they wanted to contribute more but just didn't have the time
      - the class feels like more than 4 units worth of work with the labs and other assignments, and combining that with other classes leaves little time for contributions to the actual development on the project
      - in order to contribute substantially, there
      - we think this will be resolved by the updated GitHub issues that go into much more detail about what is being done for each issue
    - time
      - people feel that many of the cool features we had in mind at the beginning of the project have to be scaled down or scrapped because of lack of time
        - this was partially because we didn't know how long some of the features would take to implement
    - wish we could have worked with more people on our team, but it would take too much time to switch up subteams and get everyone caught up
  - glad
    - most voted: accomplishments
      - people feel that we accomplished a lot more than we thought we would
        - we achieved most of the goals we set for ourselves this sprint
      - after the last sprint, many people were concerned over whether or not we would even have a finished product, but now we have an almost fully functional journal, so people are very happy with that
        - we don't think we are as behind as we felt before
      - Sanat seems to be happy with our progress as well!
    - teamwork
      - people feel that the team dynamics are really good
        - no major conflicts or anything (everyone has been respectful)
        - team members are being responsive
      - meetings across subteams were productive and helpful as well
    - functional product
      - we were able to go from an html skeleton to a working product in one sprint
        - this goes with the accomplishments
      - the design closely mirrors our initial wireframes
    - clarity
      - people feel things were much more clear during this sprint
        - we had a clear plan to execute after the first sprint
      - this is much different from last sprint, when most people were unclear on what we would be doing
## Meeting End Time: 8:30pm PST
