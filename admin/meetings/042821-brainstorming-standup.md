# Team 10 Pitch Meeting
### Date: Tuesday, April 28 @ 2:02pm PST
### Location: Zoom
### Present: Ryan, Asya, Akhil, Ivan, Nathan, Huy, Akar
### Absent: Brian, Praneet
## Discussion Points
### Github for task organization
- I (akar) did a brief demo of translating agile terminology to github planning features
    - user stories -> github issues
        - Stories are specific functionality from the user's point of view
            - e.g. User can write different types of notes based off bullet type
        - Made a GH issues template using checklists
            - brief high-level desc of story
            - checklist of tasks required to accomplish said story
        - Label and assignments
            - can assign issues to specific people/groups
            - can apply labels to organize issues (e.g. core, specialization, etc.)
    - sprints -> milestones
        - Issues can be assigned to sprints
    - kanban board -> github projects
        - Custom columns can be created
            - Lofty aspirations, Backlog, In Progress, Done, Not Working, etc.
        - Issues can be placed as cards

### Roles
- They're pretty ambigious right now
    - Architect, Scrum manager, Motivational speaker, Devs and Testers?
- Roles we have so far
    - Leaders, note-takers, repo managers
- Designers with a vision, coders to implement the vision
    - Front-end and Back-end division of labor
- What do we do when we finish our roles?
    - Don't twiddle your thumbs when you're done with your assignmenets, help out where you can!
- Coding roles
    - Object-oriented design: figure out objects, properties, and functionality
    - Have everybody do a bit of coding (this is a coding class after all!)
        - Additional roles could come after (cut and distribute the coding cake first)
        - Also avoids a low bus factor
- Core-outward design should include the whole team 
    - Everybody is a part of the design team, with a lead architect drawing the flow / diagram
    - **We need to have the design team soon**
        - **Everyone needs to attend the upcoming design meeting**
- Assignment of roles should come after design
    - currently, **designing is the bottleneck**
- Re-evaluation of roles
    - Re-assignment after sprints, reflect on the feedback and productivity with given roles
    - **Assign roles based off the needs of the sprint**

### Bullet Journal uniqueness
- How do we `sell` this product?
    - Imagine this project as something you'll sell to yourself
        - avoid 'just another project collecting dust in the repo'
        - design philosophy
- Do we want to take this into a particular field (to be more unique)?
    - Doing the field-specific bullet journal could fill a particular niche
    - Bu-Jo oriented towards fitness, finance, cooking, etc.
        - Don't lose the bullet journal aspect though!
- Or maybe prioritize the basic bulleting functionality
    - Basic functionality and decent design
    - Generalization first makes specialization later HARD
        - would go against the principle of design-first, implementation after!
- Build around the zooming feature (most uniqueness in so far)
    - field-oriented journal would be difficult in that regard
- Case study: cooking
    - Recipes wouldn't be a part of a general bullet journal
    - Reviewing and reflecting on differences from an original recipe 
        - comparison of circumstances with results
        - logging past cooking experiments to reflect on failure and success
    - Future planning 
        - compile button to generate a shopping list based off planned meals
- User philosophy and context based use-case
    - Past and reflection based
        - e.g. for cooking and experimentation
    - Present and logging
        - quickly remembering what went on
- Fork in the road: unique-factor
    - Vote on specialization relies on importance of uniqueness
        - maybe ask Sanat how unique our journal needs to be
        - Potentially asking Sanat to sit in to the first few mintues of next meeting?
- Why specialize?
    - more specialization -> less flexibility of journal
        - against the concept of flexitibity of a BuJo
        - hard to find balance between generalized (appeal to larger audience) and specialization (uniqueness)
    - incentivise members to participate
        - investment goes up when members are interested
        - might raise motivation for some while others go down :0
    - having a specialized and unique project looks better on a portfolio
- Create templates/modules for specialized functions instead of focusing on it?
    - mood trackers, cooking, etc. 

### About team conflict
- Our group has a lot of people so differing opinions and concflict is inevitable
- Just a class, just a simulation of a working environment
    - less repurcussion than reality (can't get fired / not paid)
    - still the closest thing to reality, so take advantage of the opportunity
- After a vote/decision
    - everyone must commit to the decision
    - no hard feelings

## Action items
- Project pitch due Monday!
    - Refer to Shape-Up book (should at least skim through it!) for Pitch reqs
- Next meeting is a design-oriented meeting
    - Need as many members there as possible
    - Come ready with ideas / design and create slack polls
        - guage interest / passion in design choices

## Meeting End Time: 3:15pm PST
