## Location: Zoom

## Discussion Points
- first 10-15 minutes were spent on "brain dump" to get all our ideas out on sticky notes on the [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lI_Oubw=/)
  - added features from [last meeting](/admin/meetings/042121-brainstorming.md) as well as new features we came up with in the past few days
- went over all the ideas on the [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lI_Oubw=/) and discussed/organized them
  - core features:
    - simplistic/minimalist layout (don't want to overwhelm user)
      - easy to understand for average user, but allows for access to more complex tools if the user wants them
    - rapid
      - minimize time between user opening the app and being able to take down a note
      - don't want to force the user to keep the idea in their mind for longer than they need to
      - open the journal to the daily log or blank page by default so they can immediately put down their ideas
    - search function
      - want to make sure the user can easily access past notes based on tags/keywords
    - video/audio notes
      - allows users to add notes to their logs using voice instead of typing the notes out
      - helps with accessibility
      - one of the main reasons someone would use digital bullet journal versus a physical one
    - keep track of how many times a users migrates a task
      - if the user migrates the same task a certain number of times, we should ask the user if they want to keep the task
      - helps the user reflect on whether or not they truly want to do the task
    - indexing
      - automatically update index when user creates new logs
      - user might forget to index a new log so by automating it we make sure the user will be able to click back to that log from the index later on
  - features needing additional future discussion
    - zoom out feature
      - do we want to format the journal as a bunch of pages that you flip through, or more of a "calendar" type view
      - the pages make it look like a more traditional journal, but the calendar view makes it more agreeable with a zoom out feature
      - we could try to do a hybrid format that uses pages and have a zoom out button to see all pages from the past week, and zoom out again to see pages from the past month, and so on
    - formats for logs/"subspreads"
      - do we want to give users default formats for certain logs/trackers
      - if so, we need to consider a few ways users might want to structure their logs so that the user doesn't deviate too far from the core style of a bullet journal
    - adding tags to notes
      - want to allow users to create tags for new notes
      - do we want to allow for multiple tags per note?
        - this could require more time for logging since the user might have to create multiple tags
        - also user might have to go through more clicks to add tags to a note
      - we have to consider how many tags users really need
        - we don't want to offer them extra features that look cool to the user but might actually end up making their experience worse
      - adding many tags could slow down the time it takes to log things
        - doesn't agree with core idea of rapid logging
## Action Items For Each Team Member
- update availability on the [when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/?11603179-567pm) for the coming week
- start thinking about a general design for the app
- try to start reading ["Shape Up"](https://basecamp.com/shapeup)
- create a persona/user story
## Meeting End Time: 4:55pm PST
