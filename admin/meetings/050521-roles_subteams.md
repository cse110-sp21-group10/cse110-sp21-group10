### Meeting Start Time: 2:00pm PST
### Location: Zoom
### Present: Asya, Akar, Akhil, Brian, Huy, Ivan, Nathan, Praneet, Ryan
### Absent: None!
## Discussion Points
- subteams
  - Sanat's suggestion
    - 3 teams of 2 people, and 1 team of 3 people
    - 2 of the teams working on the frontend, 2 of the teams working on the backend
    - each subteam gets their own channel on Slack for communication, and then there will be one channel for all subteams to communicate and provide updates
      - these updates should happen around twice a week
      - team leads will collect subteam updates and report them to Sanat in the weekly meeting
        - if there is a team that is having issues, the team leads will require them to come to the weekly meeting with Sanat
  - we will be going with Sanat's suggestion
    - we created a preferences [form](https://forms.gle/yNjYat6bBpphV4jm9) to decide how to form subteams
    - teams will be formed tonight
- first steps for coding
  - most (if not all) teams will be working on HTML at the beginning so that we can get a general skeleton for the app before we start adding style and functionality to it
- CI/CD pipeline
  - automated the process of adding opened issues/pull requests to the project board
  - we can't enable branch protections (we have a private repo and don't have a pro account or whatever)
    - we can't automate the process of merging pull requests when the reach a required number of approvals because we can't require a certain number approvals without branch protections
    - so, we will be using manual merging of pull requests and the honor system 
      - DON'T MERGE PULL REQUESTS UNTIL THEY HAVE THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF REVIEWS
      - we might be able to automatically label pull requests when the reach a certain number of reviews without branch protections, and then pull requests can be manually merged when they have the label of enough approvals
## Action Items
- fill out the [preferences form](https://forms.gle/yNjYat6bBpphV4jm9) by tonight so team leads can form subteams
## Meeting End Time: 2:55pm PST
