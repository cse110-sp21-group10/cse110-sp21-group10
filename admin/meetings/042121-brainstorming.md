## Discussion Points
- purpose of bullet journals
  - want to be able to keep track of valuable info
  - want to plan/track work
  - want to have something to plan out goals and track progess toward those goals
  - place to vent their frustrations
  - help people notice what tasks are important/not important
    - constantly migrating the same task indicates lack of importance
  - "mindfulness practice disguised as a productivity system"
  - emphasis on organization
- problem statement
  > Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.

  > -- David Allen
  - people have a lot of tasks and ideas going on in their day to day lives, but it is hard to keep track of them all and can lead to people feeling overwhelmed, so they need an efficient way to organize these tasks/ideas to keep focus and remain productive
  - additional problem statements we have come up with can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uubmjteofdtFs4hY2MbKtY1PKa1hNpUiLYgdOApS4ug/edit#heading=h.vwz7pfdz43p2)
- core points of bullet journals
  - index
  - rapid logging
  - logs
  - collections
  - migrations
- index
  - a place to store where in the journal each of the collections/logs is
  - in the book, it has page numbers to each of the collections/logs
  - in a web based version, we could have links to the various sections
- rapid logging
  - making specific bullets to denote tasks and other things
  - this will be used most often so we want to make this as quick as possible
  - to allow for users to log things as quickly as possble, we might want to open up to the daily log or blank page where users can immediately put down their ideas upon opening the journal, and then organize it after
  - we could include tags that the user can apply to their tasks/ideas/notes and the user can use those tags to toggle visibility later if they wanted to
- collections
  - a category page in the journal for ideas related to a specific topic
  - can be a progress tracker, log, simple list, etc
- logs
  - daily log
    - consists of day to day lists
    - daily tasks and notes go here
  - monthly log
    - consists of calendar and task list
    - these are tasks to be done on a monthly scale
    - also can add monthly events
  - future log
    - tasks and events that you want to get around to but not necessarily within the month
    - a collection used to store items that either need to be scheduled months in advance or things that you want to get around to someday
- migrations
  - shifting tasks around within the journal
  - for example, users can move things from future log to the monthly log when they are ready to do the task
- possible features
  - tags that can be assigned to notes so users can view notes grouped by tags later on
  - two modes; one for taking notes and one for reflecting/reviewing
  - keyboard shortcuts to make things faster for people who prefer only using keyboard?
  - different "zoom" levels: a daily level, weekly level, monthly level, yearly level
    - ability to quickly zoom in/out between levels to add notes to a specific level
  - option to add fitness log, financial/spending log, and/or other pre-set logs
  - default open to the daily log, since most notes people have during the day likely belong in the daily log
    - give the user the ability to change what log opens by default (daily, monthly, future, etc)
  - account system
    - let users switch accounts, but they can stay logged into an account until the specifically log out so that they can access their notes as soon as they open the journal (which allows for quicker logging of ideas)
  - different global journal themes that users can change between
  - accessibility features (ex. dyslexia-friendly font)
  - customizable bullet points for users to assign their own meanings to them
  - ability to insert videos and voice memos
  - if a user migrates the same task a certain number of times, we can ask them if they really want to keep the task
  - reminders for events and other scheduled tasks
    - tasks with reminders can be denoted with special bullet
  - also reminders for review/reflection
## Action Items
- continue brainstorming ideas for bullet journal features
- join the [Miro board](https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/5ORccX2HtfUyEbHzBVRmo1xUmUl5069cIfBMWgCREJtEwGViYzH7i02X3v86hU50) since we will be using that at our next meeting
- next meeting is on Saturday, April 24 at 3:00pm PST
