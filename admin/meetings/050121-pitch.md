## Discussion Points
- user personas
  - discussed a few different user personas
  - we should include at least one user persona with some sort of accessibility issue
  - our user personas can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mIwvxUdMOBqAEK4MvwuRU8EPaansFFLCHFxcA6rxk_Q/edit#slide=id.gd6c3d58b96_0_0)
- user stories
  - we went through the main features on our [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lI_Oubw=/) and turned them into user stories to justify their inclusion in our feature set
- starting pitch
  - we used the user personas and user stories to create our starting pitch
  - we included the problem statement, apetite, solution, rabbit holes, and no-gos
    - we need to add the wireframes and flowchart to the pitch
- design choices
  - discussed the design of our bullet journal to create wireframes for it
  - on the daily log view, the plus button at the top right will be used to create a new topic/entry in the daily log instead of creating a new page
    - that way all the topics related to that day will be available in a single scrollable page
    - users can also minimize/expand topics and migrate topics to other days
    - we can also add another button to allow the user to add widgets
  - also the plus button on the bottom right to add a new unrelated page will be removed
    - we don't want the user to be able to create completely unrelated pages since that could introduce organization problems for them and make it harder for them to find them/reflect on them later on 
  - widgets
    - widgets/trackers and reminders will appear at the top of the daily log page if they are added
      - the daily notes can extend below it because daily notes will probably be a lot longer than widgets and reminders
    - if the user adds a widget on one daily log, it adds it to all their future daily logs
    - monthly view can have widgets to show accumulation of trackers
  - migrations
    - we want to encourage users to reflect on whether or not they really need a task if they keep migrating it
      - one idea: when a task is migrated, it starts off with a green-ish color, and then each it is migrated after that, it changes color closer to red so that it draws the user's attention to it to encourage them to take action on it
        - maybe not do this idea because it could seem like it is forcing the user to address a task and might create more stress for the user
      - another idea: keep a counter next to the task and each time it is migrated, increment the counter
        - this doesn't seem like it is forcing the user to address it, just allowing them to see how many times it is migrated so they are aware of tasks they are migrating a lot of times
  - Ivan will be uploading a new sketch tomorrow morning
    - we can use the new sketch to help create our wireframes
## Action Items
- next meeting is tomorrow (Sunday, May 2) at 12:00pm PST to finish the wireframes and flowchart/system diagram
## Meeting End Time: 3:25pm PST
