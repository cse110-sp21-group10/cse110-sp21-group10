## Discussion Points
- updates for the past week
  - frontend teams have worked on styling
  - backend team has created the database wrapper class
  - we have also created the daily log object and bullet object
    - integrated them into the script to create the mvp
  - we did a demo of the mvp for Sanat
- feedback from Sanat
  - mvp looks good
  - new features to integrate
    - delete button on each bullet
      - instead of making the user delete all the text in a note to delete the note, we should add a delete button to each bullet that will allow for quick deletion of the bullet on click of that button
    - nesting bullets
      - nest a bullet by pressing tab?
        - this would be a very cool feature, but it might be tricky
      - other option is to just have a plus button for each bullet that adds a nested bullet
    - tagging bullets
      - we can just use a pre-defined set of tags, and allow for custom tag creation if we have time
      - some tags we can use for now: Academics, Work, Household, Leisure
    - create the monthly and yearly log views
    - multi-bullet selection
      - select multiple specific bullets for tagging or deletion
      - select all functionality
      - deselect all functionality
    - custom themes
      - dark mode (just flip the colors of the current black and white color scheme)
      - high contrast color scheme
      - other custom color palettes
    - trackers and widgets
      - if we want to implement widgets and trackers, we can just use a default widget (like weather) and default tracker(s) (like mood tracker) that are on every daily log, and then implement addition/deletion of widgets/trackers if we have time
  - testing
    - generate a coverage report
    - developers should not update features while they are being tested
    - make sure to focus on testing
      - get unit testing done by this week
      - also work on end to end testing
      - do manual testing before submitting repo, and document any bugs
  - do not commit any new code/features after June 7th
    - we can commit bug fixes/patches, but don't add any new features
    - June 7th to June 10th (likely when final is due) should be spent on the final assignments
      - final assignments will include documentation, videos, etc.
## Meeting End Time: 2:15pm PST
