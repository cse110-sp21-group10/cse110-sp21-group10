    - new bullet functionality allows for creating a new note when enter is pressed and creating a nested note using tab
    - exercise trackers are now presented as a row of checkboxes instead of just a percentage
  - styling
    - daily and yearly logs have been styled
    - currently working on monthly log styling

  - testing
    - unit tested all the functions
      - full coverage across lines and branches
    - creating a directory for testing documents
      - coverage reports and summary of testing can go here
    - testing is currently being done locally
      - we will be adding it as an action in the coming days
- feedback from Sanat
  - responsiveness
    - there is some level of responsiveness (looks good on iPad)
    - doesn't look as good on wide screens (like wide monitors) and phones though, but that's okay
  - labeling and bullet types are great
  - for dark mode make sure to look at the chart colors and weather widget colors to make sure they are still visible on dark background
  - only criticism is that daily notes come after trackers and reminders
    - daily notes should be the main focus, so they should come at the top
    - right now you have to scroll past the trackers and reminders to get to the notes
  - besides that, the app looks nice!
  - testing sounds like it is going well
  - wiki
    - can add a wiki page containing the team page
    - also can add a wiki page with the team roster and the important links
  - readme needs an onboarding section
  - we should finish up and close our last few issues on the project board
