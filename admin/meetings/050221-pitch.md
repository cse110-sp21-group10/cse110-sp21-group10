### Meeting Start Time: 12:00pm PST
### Location: Zoom
### Present: Asya, Akar, Akhil, Huy, Nathan, Praneet, Ryan
### Absent: Brian, Ivan
## Discussion Points
- system diagram (flowchart)
  - created the diagram showing how the user would interact with our journal application
  - the diagram can be found [here](/specs/brainstorm/pitch_brainstorming/system-diagram.png)
  - NOTE: to use Live Share with Draw.io we need to create the file using the .drawio extension (not .drawio.png)
- wireframes
  - Ivan created a new [sketch](/specs/brainstorm/BuJo_sketch2.pdf) based on what was discussed at yesterday's meeting regarding design choices
  - we used those sketches to create wireframes on the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/5fZTX8TyUDPhQepO9hAvFQ/Bullet-Journal-Wireframe?node-id=0%3A1)
- pitch
  - added the system diagram and wireframes to the pitch
  - Sanat said the pitch looks good to go!
    - only suggestion would be to add a slide on market analysis (what the competition has to offer) if we have done that analysis
      - this is optional though so since we haven't done it we don't need to include it
  - the slide deck for the pitch can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZlLTZaEbX5P9emB8swU_ZOQjWAnjrSddbrWLm0Wtk9w/edit#slide=id.p)
## Action Items
- attend the weekly meeting with Sanat on Monday at 1:00pm PST and/or the discussion section on Monday at 4:00pm PST
## Meeting End Time: 3:30pm PST
