## Primary Means of Communication and Expectations

1. Seperate channel on Slack for every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday check-ins or mini-updates from every person (#codaily-checkin). About a sentence long.
2. All members will be expected to read emails/communication from anyone in the group on a daily basis and respond in not more than 12 hours.
3. Be respectful and courteous in communication with other team members. This includes actively listening to each member's ideas and not interrupting team members when they speak.
4. Use Slack for main communications.

## Scheduling Meetings
1. If you cannot attend a meeting or will be late (5+ minutes), inform the team ahead of time in Slack.
2. Attend meetings as regularly as you can, or if you are unable to attend, review the necessary resources to catch up on what I missed.

## General Responsibilties for All Team Members
1. Be honest about whether you're feeling overwhelmed or anything of the sort. If you need help, reach out to the team or Sanat.
2. Generally, team members should comment their code so that everyone can get a general understanding of what the code does. As a general rule you should comment your code and eplain it at the top of every function. Team members should consult the documentation guideliness doc (Style Guidelines) for the standards to achieve.
3. All team members should adhere to the principles of academic integrity. If ia team member is not acting according to academic integrity, the behavior should be adressed by the team and reported to Sanat. 
4. If a team rule is broken by an individual member, this violation should be addressed in a full discussion in the team. If tea guidelines are being consistenly violated and behavior is not changing, this should be brought up and addressed with Sanat.

## Specific Team Members Responsibilities / Deadlines (optional)
1. Whoever is taking notes (Praneet and Akar as backup currently) needs to push notes to the respository after the end of each meeting.
2. As Team Leads, Ryan and Asya will attend all weekly meetings with Sanat at 1pm every Monday (other group members are also free to attend).

## Conflict Resolutions
1. When a disagreement arises, the people who are having the disagreement should meet and/or message one another to resolve this disagreement. When this disagreement is resolved, they should send a message to the updates channel on how it was resolved.
2. If the conflict isn't able to be resolved between the individuals, they should message the updates channel with a message (e.g. "the conflict is not resolved and a meeting will be required to resolve it"). Then there should be a meeting with the group to discuss and resolve the issue.
3. Team leads can help mediate these conflicts and disagreements. If team leaders are disagreeing with eachother, the team will act as mediators.
4. If the team is not able to resolve the conflict and progress must be made, there should be a vote to resolve the issue.  

## Expectation of Faculty and GTA's
1. We expect Sanat to be at the weekly Monday meetings if he planned and if there is a change in time we expect to be informed by him.
2. If we approach faculty with a conflict or academic integrity violation, we expect them to help us resolve it.
